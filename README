1. Attribution
This is basically an English translation of the Japanese plugin developed by 
the Shibuya Trac (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/shibuya-trac/) project - 
I've cleaned up a few things but the bulk of the work is theirs.

2. About
The GanttCalendar plugin adds ticket Gantt chart and calendar 
functionality to Trac (as the name suggests ;). 


3. Requirements
This plugin is only compatible with Trac version 0.11 and above - 0.10 
users will need to upgrade. The install instructions provided will only
work if you have ez_setup installed - see 
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins if you have any problems.


4. Installation
Use subversion to checkout the plugin from 
http://recurser.com/svn/ganttcalendar/trunk/
Then,

> python setup.py bdist_egg
> sudo easy_install dist/TracGanttCalendarPlugin-0.1-py2.4.egg

If you don't have ez_setup installed, see 
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins
for installation instructions


5. Configuration
To configure the plugin, you first need to add it to the [components] section
in trac.ini :

[components]
ganttcalendar.ticketcalendar.ticketcalendarplugin = enabled                                                                              
ganttcalendar.ticketgantt.ticketganttchartplugin = enabled

Next, you need to configure Trac to display a couple of extra fields in the
ticket page :

[ticket-custom]
complete = select
complete.label = % Complete
complete.options = 0|5|10|15|20|25|30|35|40|45|50|55|60|65|70|75|80|85|90|95|100
complete.order = 3
due_assign = text
due_assign.label = Start (YYYY/MM/DD)
due_assign.order = 1
due_close = text
due_close.label = End (YYYY/MM/DD)
due_close.order = 2

The start & end date fields should be inputted in the format YYYY/MM/DD. You 
can make these fields a little more user-friendly using the datefield plugin
(http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/DateFieldPlugin).
